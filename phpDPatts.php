For future PHP projects, you should definitely favor attributes over annotations. PHP 8 introduced attributes as a native, structured way to add metadata to code. Annotations, using docblocks, were a workaround and have several limitations.

Here's why attributes are superior:

Performance: Attributes are parsed and handled directly by the engine, making them significantly faster than annotations, which require separate parsing libraries.
Type Safety: Attributes support type declarations, ensuring correctness and catching errors early. Annotations, being strings, lack this type safety.
Structure: Attributes follow a defined syntax, making them more predictable and easier to analyze with static analysis tools. Annotations can be inconsistent and difficult to parse reliably.
Standard: Attributes are a built-in language feature, promoting standardization and reducing the need for external dependencies. Annotations relied on conventions and third-party libraries.
IDE Support: Modern IDEs provide better support for attributes, including autocompletion, validation, and refactoring.
While some existing projects might still rely on annotations for backward compatibility, all new code should use attributes. They provide a more robust, performant, and maintainable way to add metadata to your PHP code. Attributes are the clear future for metadata in PHP.
